# fortlang

Fortlang - an esoteric programming language based on terms from Fortnite

## Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/abhinavk99/fortlang.git
```

## Usage
```bash
$ python fortlang.py
$ input> 3 join 2
$ 5
$ input> 9 split 3
$ 3.0
```

## Features

Currently, the language is just a CLI interpreter that supports `integer OP integer`, where
the operations are adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.

## Syntax
* add is `join`
* subtract is `leave`
* multiply is `group`
* divide is `split`

## Todo
I plan on adding the features to make Fortlang an actual language instead of just a simple calculator.
